# Cxbx-Reloaded game-compatibility project

This project is intended to gather all compatibility reports for Cxbx-Reloaded.

(Cxbx-Reloaded is an original Xbox emulator, see [the Cxbx-Reloaded project on GitHub](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded).)


*This project is NOT intended for issues that are emulation-related.*

*(Emulation-related issues must be submitted to [the Cxbx-Reloaded project itself](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues).)*


All compatibility reports must be reported [here, in this issue tracker](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/issues).

In this game-compatibility project, each title is assigned ONE issue.

Do not create duplicate issues (first, search if a title already has an issue).

Duplicate reports will be merged into one, duplicates will be closed.

Unique game-compatibility issues are kept open forever, regardless of state.


Issue titles MUST mention the official title name, followed by a Title ID in square brackets, nothing else.


Use the pre-defined GitHub issue labels to indicate compatibility-attributes.

Request new labels via a separate issue (these issues *will* be closed afterwards).

Issue labels should show the compatibility for the latest tested build.


Adding screenshots to issues is allowed.

Don't add most than 8 screenshots per issue (unless more are absolutely required).


Don't flood reports with long discussions (all chit-chat is subject to removal).


Maintainers will be appointed to enforce these guidelines to all issues.

These rules are subject to change.

Our thanks go out to everyone showing an interest and/or investing time and effort in our project : Thank you very much!

- The Cxbx-Reloaded dev team.
